                In Spring 2021, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen Levy</a> and I taught a new course,
                <a href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs1340/2021sp/">
                    Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).</a> The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of
                computing and information.

                            This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled
                            <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2017fa/">
                                Networks</a>.
                            The book, like the
                            course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate
                            level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper
                            explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with
                            optional advanced sections.
